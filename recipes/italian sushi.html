    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 slices prosciutto</li>
        <li>15 basil leaves</li>
        <li>3 Roma tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 slices provolone cheese</li>
        <li>balsamic vinegar, as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay a piece of parchment on a work surface. Lay 3 slices of prosciutto on the paper, making sure each piece slightly overlaps the other.</li>
        <li>Cover prosciutto with basil leaves, about 5 leaves per slice. Layer tomatoes on top of basil. Season with pepper.</li>
        <li>Tear provolone cheese into pieces, then lay on top of tomatoes. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar.</li>
        <li>Starting from the bottom edge, gently roll prosciutto upwards into a cylinder. Wrap roll in the parchment, compressing it slightly so that it holds together.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the roll until ready to serve. Slice the roll into even pieces and remove parchment. Drizzle with more balsamic vinegar.</li>  
    </ol>
